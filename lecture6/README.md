# Lecture 6 - Front Ends

## Single Page Apps
Single-page apps take content that would ordinarily be on multiple different pages (or routes) and combine them into a single page that pulls new information from the server whenever it’s needed (through methods such as AJAX).

For a starting point, this application uses multiple pages.

```py
@app.route("/")
def first():
    return render_template("first.html")

@app.route("/second")
def second():
    return render_template("second.html")

@app.route("/third")
def third():
    return render_template("third.html")
```

Here’s the layout template for these pages.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Webpage</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <ul id="nav">
            <li><a href="">First Page</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Second Page</a></li>
            <li><a href="">Third Page</a></li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        
        {% block body %}
        {% endblock %}
        
    </body>
</html>
```

The navigation bar is simply an unordered list of links.

Given that these pages all have the simple function of displaying text, `application.py` can be reworked to run on a single route.

```py
@app.route("/")
def index():
    return render_template("index.html")

texts = ["text 1", "text 2", "text 3"]

@app.route("/first")
def first():
    return texts[0]

@app.route("/second")
def second():
    return texts[1]

@app.route("/third")
def third():
    return texts[2]
```

Note that the other **routes** don’t return a new webpage, but rather just the text that should be displayed.

In order to process this structure, JavaScript must be added to `index.html`.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script>
            document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {

                // Start by loading first page.
                load_page('first');

                // Set links up to load new pages.
                document.querySelectorAll('.nav-link').forEach(link => {
                    link.onclick = () => {
                        load_page(link.dataset.page);
                        return false;
                    };
                });
            });

            // Renders contents of new page in main view.
            function load_page(name) {
                const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
                request.open('GET', `/${name}`);
                request.onload = () => {
                    const response = request.responseText;
                    document.querySelector('#body').innerHTML = response;
                };
                request.send();
            }
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <ul id="nav">
            <li><a href="" class="nav-link" data-page="first">First Page</a></li>
            <li><a href="" class="nav-link" data-page="second">Second Page</a></li>
            <li><a href="" class="nav-link" data-page="third">Third Page</a></li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <div id="body">
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

`load_page` makes an AJAX request to the server to get the text that should be displayed and puts in the `body` `div`.

This new single-page implementation avoids reloading the page repeatedly just to display very similar content (e.g. the same navigation bar). However, this eliminates the URL’s functionality as a locator, because all the content is on the same route.

## HTML5 History API
The HTMuL5 History API allows for the manipulation of a browser’s history and URL even if the page is still being implemented with a single-page design. Whenever an new **page** is accessed, the client can **push** a new URL state.

The changes to the JavaScript code are inside the load_page function.

```js
function load_page(name) {
    const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request.open('GET', `/${name}`);
    request.onload = () => {
        const response = request.responseText;
        document.querySelector('#body').innerHTML = response;

        // Push state to URL.
        document.title = name;
        history.pushState(null, name, name);
    };
    request.send();
}
```

`document.title` is just an aesthetic property that is set to reflect the current page.

In the `history.pushState()` function, which is used to change the browser’s history, the first argument is any data that should be associated with the push, the second argument is the title of the page being pushed, and the third argument is the URL being pushed.

One flaw with this, though, is that the full multi-page behavior is not truly being emulated. If a user tries to use the back button in their browser, the URL will change, but not the content. To remedy this, the full, stack-like behavior of the HTML5 History API can be used. Going back in history should just **pop** whatever the URL is on top off of the stack.

```js
// Renders contents of new page in main view.
function load_page(name) {
    const request = new XMLHttpRequest();
    request.open('GET', `/${name}`);
    request.onload = () => {
        const response = request.responseText;
        document.querySelector('#body').innerHTML = response;

        // Push state to URL.
        document.title = name;
        history.pushState({'title': name, 'text': response}, name, name);
    };
    request.send();
}

// Update text on popping state.
window.onpopstate = e => {
    const data = e.state;
    document.title = data.title;
    document.querySelector('#body').innerHTML = data.text;
};
```

Now, when pushing a new state, title and text data is being pushed with it.

When the state is popped, `e`, the event that just took place, has a `state` property that contains all the data that was pushed with that state. Then, that data is just used to update the contents of the page as expected.
