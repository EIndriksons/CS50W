# Lecture 3 - SQL

## Databases
Databases can be used to make it easier for web applications to store, use, and manipulate data. Particularly useful are relational databases; in other words, tables.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a language designed to interact with these relational databases. In this class, PostgreSQL will be used, but there are many other versions with slightly different features.
